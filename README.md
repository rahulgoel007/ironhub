- `tools/nova-submit`. Self-contained submission tool for IronClaw Hackathon: based on NOVA decentralized file-sharing, it allows the agent to submit to the hackathon in one command using the ironclaw-hackathon skill. Replicable by all NEAR Legion city nodes or any IronClaw hackathon organizer.
- `skills/microsoft-365-workflow`. Business workflow patterns for the agent when operating inside the Microsoft 365 surface.
- `skills/pr-triage-digest`. Cross-repo GitHub PR triage. Scores every open PR on CI, mergeability, staleness, size, and review state, then emits a single ranked digest grouped into Blockers, Quick wins, First contributors, Aging, and Normal. Silent-tier; uses the built-in `http` tool — no new tool dependency. Ships a deterministic Node.js reference implementation.

## Layout

```
tools/                  WASM tool sources, one Cargo crate per tool
skills/                 SKILL.md prompt extensions, one directory per skill
use-cases/              Strict published use-case templates
wit/                    Vendored WIT contract from upstream IronClaw
scripts/                Build and packaging utilities
.github/                Issue templates, PR template, CI
```

## Tree model

A tool is a trunk. Skills are branches that grow from it. The Excel actions (`read_excel_range`, `write_excel_range`) are one trunk; an Excel-driven bookkeeping assistant or research-tracking helper are branches. Multiple skills share the same trunk and new branches do not require new tools.

This shape lives in the directory layout. Tools and skills are siblings, not paired. Coupling is declared in SKILL.md frontmatter, not in directory adjacency.

## Contributing

Issues are lightweight proposals. PRs are the source of truth.

1. Open an issue using the appropriate template: use case, new tool, new skill, or integration bug.
2. Discuss and triage the proposal.
3. Open a PR with the strict repo artifact:
   - `use-cases/<slug>/USE_CASE.md` for use cases
   - `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` for skills
   - `tools/<tool-name>/` for tools
4. CI validates use cases and runs Rust checks for tools.
5. Reviewer merges to `main`.
6. When the integration is ready for upstream IronClaw, run `scripts/pack-for-ironclaw.sh` to produce the upstream layout for a PR into `nearai/ironclaw`.
