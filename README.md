## Layout

```
tools/                  WASM tool sources, one Cargo crate per tool
skills/                 SKILL.md prompt extensions, one directory per skill
wit/                    Vendored WIT contract from upstream IronClaw
scripts/                Build and packaging utilities
.github/                Issue templates, PR template, CI
```

## Tree model

A tool is a trunk. Skills are branches that grow from it. The Excel actions (`read_excel_range`, `write_excel_range`) are one trunk; an Excel-driven bookkeeping assistant or research-tracking helper are branches. Multiple skills share the same trunk and new branches do not require new tools.

This shape lives in the directory layout. Tools and skills are siblings, not paired. Coupling is declared in SKILL.md frontmatter, not in directory adjacency.

## Contributing

1. Open an issue using the appropriate template (new tool, new skill, or integration bug).
2. Branch and implement.
3. Open a PR. CI runs `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test` on every tool crate.
4. Reviewer merges to main.
5. When the integration is ready for upstream IronClaw, run `scripts/pack-for-ironclaw.sh` to produce the upstream layout for a PR into `nearai/ironclaw`.
