## Tools

| Name | Status | Version | Use Cases | Value Tags | Description | Limits | Author |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `microsoft-365` | live | 0.1.0 | List recent Outlook emails, Manage OneDrive and SharePoint files, Send Teams channel messages | Automation, Productivity | Microsoft Graph integration. 14 actions across Outlook, Excel, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, Calendar, plus Word and PowerPoint document generation. OAuth via Microsoft Entra ID. | Teams actions return 403 on personal Microsoft accounts (Microsoft does not serve Teams business APIs to consumer MSAs). Simple upload capped at 4 MB; chunked upload session not yet implemented. | Brandon |
| `near-rpc` | live | 0.1.0 |  |  | NEAR Protocol JSON-RPC integration. 27 actions covering account state, access keys, contract storage and code, view function calls, blocks, chunks, validators, transaction lifecycle with finality control, state changes, network status, gas and protocol config, and light-client proofs. No credentials required for read actions. | Public RPC endpoints rate-limit aggressively; production deployments should use FastNEAR, Pagoda, or another dedicated provider. Signed-write actions (`send_tx`, `broadcast_tx_async`, `broadcast_tx_commit`) accept a pre-signed base64-encoded `SignedTransaction`; the tool does not perform local signing. Validator-set, state-change, and contract-code responses can be megabytes in size on busy blocks. | Brandon |
| `polymarket` | live | 0.1.0 | Query real-time election odds, Track crypto prediction markets, Feed sentiment data into trading agents | Data Feed, Web3 | Polymarket public market intelligence integration. 36 actions covering markets, events, tags, series, sports, search, orderbooks, prices (single and batch), historical prices, position holdings, user activity, trades, trader leaderboards, profiles, and comments across the Polymarket prediction-market platform. Routes between `gamma-api.polymarket.com` (discovery), `clob.polymarket.com` (market data), and `data-api.polymarket.com` (user-scoped reads). No authentication required. | Public list endpoints cap at 500 entries per request. Batch price endpoints accept up to 500 token IDs per call. WebSocket subscriptions are deferred until the IronClaw runtime exposes a WebSocket primitive to wasm tools. Signed CLOB write operations (post and cancel orders, manage relayer, bridge) live in the separate `polymarket-clob` trunk. | Brandon |
| `nova-submit` | live | 0.1.0 | | | IronClaw Hackathon submission tool. Encrypts a file with AES-256-GCM and uploads to a NOVA group on NEAR. Built as the trunk that the ironclaw-hackathon skill calls to submit hackathon entries. Replicable by any IronClaw hackathon organizer. | Need to create an account at https://nova-sdk.com and collect account-id and api key. | Julien |
