### 1. Title

Stablecoin Supply Tracker — Weekly liquidity inflow monitor with Telegram alerts

### 2. Example prompt

You are my stablecoin supply tracker. Monitor USDT market cap and alert me when significant liquidity enters the crypto market.

Create a routine that runs every day at 9:00 AM UTC:

1. Fetch USDT market cap from CoinGecko:
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/tether

Extract: current market cap in USD

2. Read memory at stablecoin/supply.md using memory_read.
If file does not exist, create it with today's snapshot as the baseline.

3. Append today's snapshot to memory:
- Date
- USDT market cap
- Change vs 7 days ago

4. Calculate 7-day change:
- Find the entry from 7 days ago in memory
- Calculate difference in USD

5. Every Sunday at 9:00 AM send a weekly report regardless of threshold:

"💵 Stablecoin Supply — Weekly Report

USDT Market Cap: $[X]B
7-Day Change: [+/-]$[X]B
30-Day Change: [+/-]$[X]B

[📈 Liquidity INFLOW — bullish signal if +$500M+ weekly]
[📉 Liquidity OUTFLOW — bearish signal if -$500M+ weekly]
[➡️ Stable — no significant movement]"

6. On any day — if 7-day change exceeds +$1B: also send immediate alert:

"🚨 Stablecoin Supply Alert
USDT grew +$[X]B in 7 days — major liquidity inflow detected.
Historically bullish signal for crypto markets."

### 3. What the agent does

Every day the agent fetches USDT market cap from CoinGecko and logs it to persistent memory. It builds its own 30-day price history over time.

Every Sunday it sends a weekly report showing 7-day and 30-day supply changes with a directional signal — inflow, outflow, or stable. If supply grows more than $1B in a week at any point, it fires an immediate alert. The longer the agent runs, the more context it builds — after a month you have a real liquidity trend dataset built automatically.
